# kafka-connector

The Kafka REST Connector provides a RESTful interface to a Kafka broker or a cluster. It makes it easy to produce and consume data, view the state of the cluster, and perform administrative actions without using the native Kafka protocol or clients. 

Examples of use cases include reporting data to Kafka from any front-end app built in any language, ingesting data into a app from Kafka, and scripting administrative actions.
